  <body>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Hey {{re_sa}} {{re_name}},</p>
    <p>Hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy!<br>
      We thank you for participating in the PenPal initiative. All
      registered participants have been randomly sorted into pairs, and
      this mail is intended to inform you about your pen pal.</p>
    <p>Your pen pal is (*drumrolls*) :<br>
      Name: {{pe_sa}} {{pe_name}}, <br>
      Roll number: {{pe_r}}<br>
      Webmail: <a href="mailto:{{pe_u}}">{{pe_u}}</a></p>
    <p>You can now go and hit them up over Webmail, and shift to other
      platforms if both the parties are comfortable and consenting.</p>
    <p>Keeping in mind the suggestions we received during the
      registration process, we have decided to slightly delay the
      timeline of calling in answers to the questions related to your
      pen pal to post-end sem time. The updated timeline would be
      reflected soon on the website.<br>
